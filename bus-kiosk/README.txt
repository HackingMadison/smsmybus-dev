The three files listed here contain the bulk of the functionality to deploy a bus kios that displays arrival estimates for specified Metro stops. However, there are still some tasks that you'll need to do to get it running.

Big thank you to Preston Austin for starting this work and doing the vast majority of the HTML and styling.

index.html :: Primary HTML that displays the API data
 @todo fix the path to the jquery-timers library.
 @todo add your own API key to the JavaScript calls in the header. you can get one by emailing api@smsmybus.com
 @todo you'll probably want to update the artwork in the header

kiosk.css :: Styling sheet

kiosk.js :: Self-contained JavaScript code that fetches the data from the API
